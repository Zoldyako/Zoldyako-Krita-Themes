# Zoldyako's Themes for Krita

This repository will be the default place for download my themes for Krita. 

later I'll add for this README:
- Prints of the themes
- How to install the themes (DONE)
- Maybe how to make your own themes

How to install:
- Open Krita, go to: Settings > Manage Resources > Open Resources Folder
- Open the "color-schemes" folder
- Copy and paste the themes' zip file
- Extract the zip file
- Close and open Krita again to Krita load the themes
- Then go to Settings > Themes > Chose your theme!
