# Zoldyako's Themes for Krita

This repository will be the default place for download my themes for Krita. 

later I'll add for this README:
- Prints of the themes
- How to install the themes (DONE)
- Maybe how to make your own themes

How to install:
    1 - Open Krita, go to: Settings > Manage Resources > Open Resources Folder
    2 - Open the “color-schemes” folder
    3 - Copy and paste the themes' zip file
    4 - Extract the zip file
    5 - Close and open Krita again to Krita load the themes
    6 - Then go to Settings > Themes > Chose your theme!
