# Zoldyako's Themes for Krita

**You can modify and redistribuite any of these files, I only ask you to credit me :) @zoldyako in any social media**

### How to download
- Go to [Themes Release Page](https://github.com/Zoldyako/Zoldyako-Krita-Themes/releases)
- Look for "Assets" (in case it is collapsed just click it)
- Select the themes you want to download
- You're done! :)

### How to install and use:
1. In Krita, look to the menu bar at the very top
2. Select: Settings > Manage Resources
3. With the Manage Resource window open, select the "Open Resource Folder"
4. Look for the "color-schemes" folder
5. If you have my old themes I sugest you to delete them and replace it with the new ones
6. Copy and paste the themes' zip file in the color-schemes folder
7. Extract the .colors files from the zip file you downloaded  
8. Now you need to close and re-open Krita for the themes to be available
9. Then you just need to go to Settings > Themes > Chose your theme!

(in case you downloaded the "all themes" file I recomend you to delete the themes you don't want after testing then)
