This repository will be the default place for downloading my themes for Krita. 

later I'll add for this README:

- How to install the themes (DONE)

### How to download
- Click on the green button "Code"
- Then click on "Download Zip" 

### How to install:
- Open Krita, go to: Settings > Manage Resources > Open Resources Folder
- Open the "color-schemes" folder
- Copy and paste the themes' zip file
- Extract the zip file
- Close and open Krita again to Krita load the themes
- Then go to Settings > Themes > Chose your theme!
- I recomend you to delete the themes you don't want
